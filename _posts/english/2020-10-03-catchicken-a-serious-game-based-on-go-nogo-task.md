## What is Catchicken?

**Catchicken** is a serious game based on Go/NoGo task that we utilized in our research to measured children response and their gaze behavior during the task. The game represented the Go stimulus and NoGo stimulus as "cat" and "chicken" characters, respectively. So, a child should response only when the cat appeared but he must inhibit his action when the chicken appeared.

## What does matter with children's response and gaze behavior?
Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are examples of invisible disorder whose symptoms often misinterpreted as wilful misconduct or bad character. The children with disorder, however, need early intervention to mitigate the disorder symptoms.

Previous works found that ADHD children's **response time was slower and more varied** compared to the typical one during Go/NoGo task. They also discovered that children with ASD **could not focus** on the conversant's face during face-to-face conversation and **often got distracted with the surronding**.

Hence, we thought that measuring those features may help teachers and clinicians to identify disorders symptoms in early childhood. Also, we hope that we can utilize this system to monitor the disorder children's performance during attention and impulsivity rehabilitation.
