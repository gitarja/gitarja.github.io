### Why I conduct this research?

How often do you feel distressed when you must face things you never imagine? Today’s society changes rapidly and demands us to adapt to new conditions quickly. For example, nowadays, getting a job requires you to have skills that you never heard from or imagined in your high-school.

However, because of the increase in maintaining well-being, people become more frequent to seek help from psychiatrists. But, because of stigma, complicated procedure, unaffordable price, and distrust to share private matters, many of them give up to visit and consult with therapists.

myConfidant is here to help people meet with their therapist. With the app, users can search therapists that match their criteria, select the one that they like, and arrange the schedule with the therapist through smartphone in 5 minutes.



### Problems

1. People are eager to consult with therapists but they do not know how to start
2. Different people have different problems that should meet with the therapist's speciality and experience
3. People worry to talk with therapists about their personal matter

### Goals
1. Identify the paint points to find and arrange schedule with therapists
2. Understand users' preference on how they want to counsult with their therapists


### Summary of the study
I conduct secondary and primary research to find what kinds of features that users need in customer service app for therapist. The main users are clients who want to use therapists’ service. Therapists can upload detail of their education background, experience, and schedule to app.

> The study focuses on understanding pain points of “prospective” clients and people who already have regular consultation with therapist. I designed the questions to explore the users’ experience with therapists and their expectation to make an appointment and communicate with the therapists.

### Methodology

I conducted interview involving participants aged 18-35 years. They should live in urban or metropolitan areas and ever face stressful conditions affecting their well-being. The participants were people four different nationalities living five different countries. One participant belonged to sexual minorities group.

Before the interview I explained the goal of the study and asked their consent to record audio.

### Scripts

Hi, how is your day?
Before we begin this interview, would you mind if I take audio of this interview?

I want you to know that this is not a test, so there are no right or wrong answers in this interview. If you have any questions, I will be happy to hear about them. I will use this interview to design an app to find therapists and arrange schedule with them.


** Basic questions:**
- Have you experienced stressful conditions that affect your well-being? (e.g., you cannot sleep because of work pressure)
- Have you had in your mind to go to a therapist?

**Interview questions:**
1. Would you mind sharing with me about your stressful condition?
2. Did you ever go to a therapist to discuss your mental health condition?
	- Yes: How do you find and why do you choose that therapist?
	- No: What makes you put aside the idea of going to a therapist?
3. Could you describe what you think is the most convenient way to make an appointment with the therapist?
	- How do you think if somehow you feel calmer, will you cancel the appointment?
		- Yes: what do you think about  cancellation fee?
		- No: why you do not want to cancel it?
4. Are you more comfortable discussing with your therapist in face-to-face conversation or phone calls?
	- Can you tell me the reason of it?
	- AI-bot:
		- Have u ever used it?
5. Do you think you need to communicate daily with the therapist?
6. If you want to give feedback to a therapist? how will you do that?
