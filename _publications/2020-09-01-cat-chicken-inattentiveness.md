We present a Go/NoGo 3D game equipped with an eye tracker that records subjects' responses and his gaze position on the monitor over time. The proposed system consists of two functions: training that allows an instructor to modify the game's parameters and make a customized test; and evaluation in which the instructor can fix the parameters to create a standardized test. During the experiment, subjects were required to respond only to Go character by pressing a spacebar. The experimental results from 59 participants demonstrated that one's response time and its variability correlated with one's gaze behavior. Subjects with higher gaze modulation tended to respond faster and more stable. We also observed that utilizing the proposed system we could monitor the improvements in an Autism Spectrum Disorder child during his rehabilitation: his gaze modulation increased and his response time became more steady. In brief, utilizing the proposed system, we could effectively measure participants' response time variability of NoGo errors and their gaze trajectory area, which previous studies found to have a strong relationship with symptoms of mental disorders.
