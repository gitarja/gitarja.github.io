Hi, I am Prasetia. I have been completing my doctoral course at Yokohama National University. I worked at multiple view human activity using DNN during my master. When I started doctoral course, I focused more on conducting study to develop diagnosis support system to identify developmental disorder children in symptoms.

I am curious, trying new things. When covid-19 pandemic started, I tried several activities to spend my time during weekends and I ended up with drawing and climbing mountains. Recently, I have taken online UX course to understand how I can understand usersâ€™ perspective so I can use my skill to solve their problem.

If you are interested in my research, please contact me at prasetia-putra-kt[at]ynu.jp.
