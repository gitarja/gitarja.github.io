A slave of curiosity. I am Prasetia. I have been working to help parents understand more about their children. I have been studying Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder by observing children's behavior and their brain imaging.

I love many things:
- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning (just start loving it recently)
- Books (I do not have specific preference: romance, horror, medieval story, tech, LGBT, religions, philosophy, and sometimes arts)
- TV series (Game of Throne)
- Children (I believe every child deserves for proper education)
- Writing
