I study human behavior through the lens of social signal processing and physiological sensing. I’ve always been fascinated by how people think, feel, and coordinate with each other — and how these subtle patterns can be captured through eye movements, body dynamics, and heart signals. During my PhD, I collaborated with Yamaha Motor Company to develop an affect-recognition device, which strengthened my interest in linking real-world behavior with computational models. I also developed diagnostic support systems using multimodal data to identify early cognitive and developmental differences. Today, my work focuses on understanding how people anticipate and interact in dynamic environments, with the long-term goal of creating technologies that enhance and improve human–machine and human–human interaction.
