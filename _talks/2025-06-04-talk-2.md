Here, I presented practical guidance on how to use deep-learning–based facial expression recognition models. In the talk, I explained to the community which aspects of these models are useful and what their limitations are. I also highlighted factors they should be aware of, such as the lateral position of the face in the image and the demographic background of participants whose facial expressions are being analyzed automatically.
