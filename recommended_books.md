<div id="book_summary">I see Richard Feynman as a colorful scientist who is very curious about his surroundings. One of his famous quotes is "what I cannot create, I do not understand" that tells us we only can fully understand a concept if when can reproduce it. This book gives us a picture of Richard Feynman's journey from his childhood until he became a professor at CALTECH. His journey brings you to another realm that some of us have left for a long time ago, our childhood curiosity to prove what we heard and to observe what we found.</div>

<div id="book_summary">Our mind comprises two systems that collaborate to represent and interact with the world around us. While System 1 works by valuing our experience and the information that exists at that time, which makes it very prone to bias, System 2 relies on the knowledge that we know. That is why System 2 is slower than System 1. Although System 2 helps us to refine and rationalize the result proposed by System 1, it also has its own flaws since our knowledge is limited. Hence, we should be careful and suspect our own judgment as it may hide a mistake that we do not realize. </div>

<div id="book_summary">"The more educated a person, the better he makes a justification for his action" is one thing that this book tells about. It is human nature to classify things into the right group or the wrong one as our brain cannot accept disarrangement. Reading this book will give you an insight into why there are other people who think differently than you and why you often cannot accept what others believe on.  </div>

<div id="book_summary">Two innocent children found each other in a universe that welcomed them and pushed them to the margin at the same time. As innocent as they were, they explored the universe together without knowing what they should aim. Thousands of stars guided and misled them to an answer that they did not intend to find. Juvenile love lied between them and started polluting their dream. Each of them expressed his affection in his own way. And as two philosophers who tried to answer the big secret of the universe, they finally made their first discovery. "A secret that rotated around their love story".</div>

<div id="book_summary">A journey gives you joy and time to learn from your past. It is a moment when you leave your routine so you get a chance to see this world differently. You may see all the things that you never expect to see as they reveal themselves in front of your eyes during your vacation. And in this time as well, you can read the "path" that you have written and wonder about the next one that you should take.</div>
