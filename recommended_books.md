<div id="title">The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/statistics.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Statistics is a tool that we can use to reveal information in data. Like other tools, it produces what its users expect and depends on their expertise. It may unveil the secrets of the universe or bias the truth that lay ahead of us. Statistics is also prone to its users' willing: it cannot reveal the lies that are fed to it by its master. In the era of big data, we who want to survive have to pursue statistic literacy - so we became less ignorant.</div>

<div id="title">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/bad_blood.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">"Fake it until you make it" is a jargon that sounds ambitious and has been adopted by many tech companies. While users of software only get frustrated by the bugs found in it, users of the medical system may get killed. This book reminds me that not all brilliant ideas survive since some of them get sunk to the bottom of the sea because the current circumstances do not support it. It was like the fate of artificial neural networks in the 90s, while many people were skeptics and thrown away the idea; until the advance of computer hardware such as GPU that enables ANN to be trained with a big dataset and outperforms the conventional ML algorithms. Maybe, if the founders of this startup focused on solving the basic problems first, then implemented their revolutionary idea - maybe they would win.</div>

<div id="title">The Art of Thinking Clearly</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/art_thinking_clearly.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Cognitive skill contributes to the human race's causes to advance over other creatures, but it does not mean it is without flaw. The cognitive error happens frequently in our daily activities. For example, we often end up buying on-sale products that we do not need because the "last-chance" sign is put on them. Or we feel more hurt when we break off from our friend after a one-year relationship but feel less when she is the one we know three months ago.  The book tells us more cognitive errors that we often face but do not realize. We cannot eliminate these errors from our life yet avoiding them and reducing their effects are possible by criticizing ourselves.</div>

<div id="book_summary">We were born and raised in a family. We inherited both our ancestors' physical appearance and their experience - that includes their fear and prejudice. We hate what they hate and think what is right from their lens. So the first mission in our life should be fighting against the prejudice that we have unconsciously built till now - and it only can be won with curiosity and education.</div>

<div id="title">Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/upheaval.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Every individual will face crises in his life. If he can tackle them he survives, otherwise, he vanishes. Like an individual, a nation also will meet its own crises that require all components of it to make selective changes thus the nation can survive. Both an individual and a nation can only pull through a crisis if first, they acknowledge that they are in a crisis then take the responsibility to solve it. For us as human, can we survive crises that we are suffering now e.g. global warning, spreading epidemic, and shrinking vital commodities if we close our eyes upon them?</div>

<div id="title">A Beautiful Mind</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/a_beautiful_mind.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Life is a struggle to balance between what you want and what society expects. It is fragile as many people stumble down just after seeing their glory. It is a conflict between solitude and company. Yet, life also provides hours of enjoyment when you achieve prestige and get acknowledged for it. That is a chaotic cycle that may thrust you up from the bottom of a dreadful valley. Life, indeed, is a perfect harmony between cooperativeness and rivalry.</div>

<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/letter_to_a_young_scientist.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Being a scientist truly requires an ability to find an important issue and raise questions from it then solve them. Science does not force you to deliver a perfect solution at the first step but it demands a creative approach so people can understand better about the issue. There is no scientist who works alone, collaboration and competition are mandatory to deliver insightful finding.</div>

<div id="title">Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/infinite_powers.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Richard Feynman said "Calculus is the language of God". This book does not tell the difficulty of calculus exercises so only God can solve them. Yet, it describes many aspects in this world that can be explained using calculus e.g. the effect of HIV drug, planets' orbit, and movement of temperature. It also narrates how calculus itself has been developed till now. Reading this book will answer your big question in school "why should I learn this confusing mathematical formula?"</div>

<div id="book_summary">Bediuzzaman Said Nursi is an Islamic scholar living in the early year of Republic of Turkey.  The author of this book summarized  The Risale-i Nur Collection, a tafsir on the Quran written by Nursi. The book describes Nursi's perspective on how a Muslim should contemplate his purpose in this world and how he should live in harmony with other creatures. Although the book glances upon life principles of an Islamic cleric, a reader of this book can get a glimpse of a viewpoint of monotheism society in general.</div>

<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/surely_youarejoking_feynman.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">I see Richard Feynman as a colorful scientist who is very curious about his surroundings. One of his famous quotes is "what I cannot create, I do not understand" that tells us we only can fully understand a concept if when can reproduce it. This book gives us a picture of Richard Feynman's journey from his childhood until he became a professor at CALTECH. His journey brings you to another realm that some of us have left for a long time ago, our childhood curiosity to prove what we heard and to observe what we found.</div>

<div id="title">Thingking, Fast and Slow</div>
<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/thingking_fast_and_slow.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Our mind comprises two systems that collaborate to represent and interact with the world around us. While System 1 works by valuing our experience and the information that exists at that time, which makes it very prone to bias, System 2 relies on the knowledge that we know. That is why System 2 is slower than System 1. Although System 2 helps us to refine and rationalize the result proposed by System 1, it also has its own flaws since our knowledge is limited. Hence, we should be careful and suspect our own judgment as it may hide a mistake that we do not realize. </div>

<div id="book_summary">"The more educated a person, the better he makes a justification for his action" is one thing that this book tells about. It is human nature to classify things into the right group or the wrong one as our brain cannot accept disarrangement. Reading this book will give you an insight into why there are other people who think differently than you and why you often cannot accept what others believe on.  </div>

<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/aristotle_dante_universe.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">Two innocent children found each other in a universe that welcomed them and pushed them to the margin at the same time. As innocent as they were, they explored the universe together without knowing what they should aim. Thousands of stars guided and misled them to an answer that they did not intend to find. Juvenile love lied between them and started polluting their dream. Each of them expressed his affection in his own way. And as two philosophers who tried to answer the big secret of the universe, they finally made their first discovery. "A secret that rotated around their love story".</div>

You may see all the things that you never expect to see as they reveal themselves in front of your eyes during your vacation.

<div id="book_summary">Have you ever wondered how your brain works? This book talks about the complex human brain; a complexity that is formed by a repetitive simplicity. There are two main parts of a human brain, the old part and the new one. The old part is a side that is used to regulate body function. While the new part is a side that processes information, called neucortex.</div>

<div id="book_img"><img width="200px" height="auto" src="/assets/recommended_books/failure_science.jpg"></div>
<div id="book_summary">In science, we made progress by making a failure. That is not a failure without a plan or because of carelessness. That is planned failure that we "expect" to happen and lead us to an unexpected finding that does exist and wait to be discovered. This book tells us that in science the more failure that we experience, the more things that we will learn.</div>

Nothing is more important for us than ourselves. We are an egocentric creature who pretends to care about others.
