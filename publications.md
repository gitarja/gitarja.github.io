**Conference: 2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)**

**Abstract:** Most methods of multi-view human activity recognition can be classified as conventional computer vision approaches. Those approaches separate feature descriptor and discriminator. Hence, the feature extractor cannot learn from the mistakes made by the classifier. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) model for human activity estimation using multi-view sequences of raw images is presented. This approach incorporates features extractor and discriminator into a single model. The model comprises three parts, a convolutional neural network (CNN) block, MSLSTMRes, and a dense layer. This method enables discrimination of human activity such as “walk” and “sit down” by merely using sequences of raw images. Experimental results on IXMAS dataset using one-subject cross validation demonstrates high prediction rate that is comparable to other methods in the literature, which utilized preprocessed images such as silhouette and volumetric data and sophisticated feature extractor.

**Conference: 2014 1st International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory, and Applications**

**Abstract:** Human emotion recognition has been challenging issue in field of human-computer interaction. In order to form an interaction that is more natural between human and computer , the computer should be able to discern and respond to human emotion. In this paper, an approach for recognizing human emotion is proposed. The proposed approach operates HAAR-classifier to detect mouth, eyes, and eyebrow on face, and, to extract features from them, it uses Gabor wavelet. Before classifying the features, PCA is performed to reduce its dimension. The proposed framework employs SLFNs with ELM as its learning algorithm to classify the features. In this experimental, the proposed framework is tested in two cases, personalize and generalize face case, with ten subjects expressing six basic emotions and neural state. The robustness of ELM is evaluated with comparing it to K-NN and SVM. Preliminary experiment shows that the proposed approach has promising performance in personalize face case.
