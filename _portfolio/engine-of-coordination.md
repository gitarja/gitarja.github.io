This project investigates the fundamental mechanisms that allow humans to coordinate and compete during dynamic interactions. By combining multimodal behavioral data—such as movement, gaze, and physiological signals—with computational modeling, the study examines how people predict each other’s actions, adapt their strategies, and shift between cooperation and competition. The goal is to uncover the basic “engine” of coordination: the perceptual and cognitive processes that enable individuals to align with partners, outperform opponents, and flexibly transition between the two modes. Insights from this work aim to advance our understanding of human social behavior and support the design of more intuitive collaborative and competitive human–machine systems.
