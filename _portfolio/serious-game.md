The CatChicken game is a serious-game version of the Go/NoGo task designed to measure children’s inattentiveness and impulsivity by tracking both their motor responses and gaze behavior. During the game, children press a key to respond to “chicken” (Go) stimuli and inhibit their action toward “cat” (NoGo) stimuli, while an eye tracker continuously records their gaze position. The system generates detailed behavioral data—including response accuracy, reaction times, gaze trajectories, and gaze-to-stimulus alignment—which are then used to extract spatial and gaze-adjustment features. These features enable statistical analysis and machine-learning models to identify patterns associated with developmental disorder symptoms, particularly ASD and ADHD.
